This is the source for my site. It's built with [hugo](https://hugo.io/).

Feel free to use anything you find here for your own use, just make sure to add

the site itself. Officially the license is GPLv3.

If you want to use this repo as a template, you will have to modify the command
inside `deploy.sh` to push changes in `public/` to your server. Otherwise,
everything should just work.
