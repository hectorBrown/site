Pretty self explanatory. Here's a long list of some of the coolest places online. I really wish I'd known about a lot of these earlier. I've tried to focus on sites that might be a bit more obscure, leaving out the really obvious ones that we all use often. It's a bit of an eclectic, self-indulgent set, but I think all these sites are worth knowing about so... in no particular order:

## Advent of Code <a href="https://adventofcode.com/" target="_blank"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>

<img src="/images/blog/best-sites/advent-of-code.png" style="width: 100%"></img>

Advent of Code is an advent calendar with a new coding challenge for each day. After all, what embodies the holiday spirit more than debugging for the vast majority of Christmas day.

Eric Wastl, year after year, produces a series of 25 high-quality problems, with a unique story to follow. They increase in difficulty each day, so the first should be achievable for complete beginners, but I've never really made a dent in the 20s.

If that wasn't attractive enough, the community around it is very active, especially in December. There's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode" target="_blank">subreddit</a> where you can find interesting solutions, hints, and cool visualisations, and a <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard" target="_blank">leaderboard</a> on the site, with an option to maintain a private one for your friends.

If you're interested you can take a look at <a href="https://github.com/hectorBrown/aoc2022" target="_blank">my solutions for 2022</a> (other years are available in repos with similar names), and a work-in-progress <a href="https://github.com/hectorBrown/aocstat" target="_blank">terminal client</a> that I've been adding to sporadically.

## xkcd <a href="https://xkcd.com/" target="_blank"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>

<!--<div style="float: left; margin: 1vw"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/sloped_border.png"></img></div>-->

xkcd is far and away my favourite webcomic. The content ranges from nerdy-funny (see tsp vs tbsp) to nerdy-cool (see movie character interaction diagram) and back again. I've found out about so many new concepts in STEM just as a result of finding this site.

<a href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">Explain xkcd</a> is an equally cool site dedicated to ruining every joke Randall Munroe makes by picking it apart and deconstructing the thought process behind every scene.

There is also a <a href="https://blog.xkcd.com/" target="_blank">blog</a>, and several different <a href="https://xkcd.com/books/" target="_blank">books</a>, none of which, admittedly, I have read, so I can't vouch for them but I'm willing to bet they're pretty good.

Some comics are related to projects that are much more than just an image, like the <a href="https://xkcd.com/color/rgb/" target="_blank">xkcd colour survey</a>, or <a href="https://geohashing.site/geohashing/Main_Page" target="_blank">geohashing</a>.

The best idea, if you want to stay up-to-date, is to subscribe to the [RSS feed](https://xkcd.com/rss.xml), or <a href="https://xkcd.com/newsletter/" target="_blank">mailing list</a>.

_There's also the <a href="https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.xkcd.html" target="_blank">matplotlib xkcd mode</a>._

## 10minutemail <a href="https://10minutemail.com/" target="_blank"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>

<img src="/images/blog/best-sites/10-minute-mail.png" style="width: 100%"></img>

A bit of a departure from the last one, this one is very practical, but has saved me so much time. I'm sure almost everybody knows about disposable email services like this, and <a href="https://www.guerrillamail.com/" target="_blank">Guerrilla Mail</a> (which also lets you send email, in case that's something you need), but just in case: 10minutemail gives you a personal email address for just (you guessed it) 10 minutes. This can be very handy for throwaway accounts that require email verification, or...... well, that's really the only use case I can think of, but it's very good at it and there are bound to be others.

## ArchWiki <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/" target="_blank"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>

<img src="/images/blog/best-sites/archwiki.png" style="width: 100%"></img>

It's hard to overstate how valuable of a resource the ArchWiki is for any Linux user, even if you don't use Arch, although, honestly, the wiki is reason enough to install it. I can't think of another website that has taught me as much as this one about software. Every article is specific, well layed out, and thorough. It's rare that you have a question that the site can't answer. I wish that I had developed the instinct to check it first sooner, it would have saved me hours of aimless searching.

The forums are also an honourable mention here. Obviously, they have a bit of a bad reputation, and while users aren't always overly friendly or polite to new users, they are, in my experience, always helpful.

## Wolfram Alpha <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/" target="_blank"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>

<img src="/images/blog/best-sites/wolfram-alpha.png" style="width: 100%"></img>

Wolfram Alpha is singlehandedly doing my degree for me. Hand it pretty much any mathematical, scientific, technological, or general trivia question (in natural language, by the way), and it'll hand you an answer.

It's particularly good at maths, and especially useful for calculating integrals, solving systems of equations, inverting matrices, etc.. Basically, tasks that you don't want to do by hand, and can't be bothered to read documentation for.

## VimGolf <a href="https://www.vimgolf.com/" target="_blank"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>

<img src="/images/blog/best-sites/vimgolf.png" style="width: 100%"></img>

If you're completely new to vim, I'd recommend vimtutor, but if you have been using vim for a bit and are just looking to improve, VimGolf is a lot of fun.

The site gives you a start and end file. The goal is to get from one to the other in the fewest keystrokes.

I've seen arguments elsewhere online that golfing like this is not a good way to improve your productivity. A lot of the very small solutions utilise tricks that you'd never probably use day-to-day, but progressing up the grades normally involves learning new keys or modes that you actually might find useful.

There's even a command line tool to make downloading, recording, and submitting challenges a breeze. My only criticism is that the site only allows authentication with Twitter. If you're like me, that will mean making an account in order to use it, which is a bit annoying.

A couple tips that might boost you a spot on the leaderboard:
- Never `:wq`, always `ZZ`.
- `{` and `}` move the cursor by paragraph.
- `Q` enters ex mode, which allows you to run a series of commands without the leading `:`s.
- Read up on <a href="https://learnvim.irian.to/basics/registers" target="_blank">registers</a>, especially the special ones.
- <a href="https://learnvim.irian.to/basics/macros" target="_blank">Macros</a> are essential, both in golf, and everywhere else.

## Project Euler <a href="https://projecteuler.net/about" target="_blank"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>

<img src="/images/blog/best-sites/project-euler.png" style="width: 100%"></img>

Another set of coding challenges, this time with a mathematical slant. Again, the difficulty ranges from very easy to stupidly difficult so there's something for everybody. There are also, as of writing this, a huge library of 837 problems to try.

## regex101 <a href="https://regex101.com/" target="_blank"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>

<img src="/images/blog/best-sites/regex101.png" style="width: 100%"></img>

This site changed my life. Before I knew about it, I lived, like most people do, in constant terror that I would ever have to construct a regex. Just the sight of a string calling out for validation made me quiver in fear. The ability to debug and access a reference makes it, honestly, pretty fun to write patterns. These days, I'm a changed man; I happily write regex when it's needed, instead of constructing long, unreadable sequences of conditionals to validate text. 

The other great thing is that this site will make you better at regex even when you're not using it. The more you enjoy writing it, the more you write, and the more you write, the better you get. My new skills with grep, and vim's `/`  and `:s` mean I can produce more efficient (and general) code, faster.

## keyserver.ubuntu.com <a href="https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/" target="_blank"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>

So this is a webpage, but not really in the same sense as the ones above. However it is still technically on the web, so I'm including it.

I'm sure most people are aware of OpenPGP keyservers, but when I started using GnuPG I wasn't, and was pretty confused about how software like that could really be practical when you had to manually exchange keys with anyone you were communicating with.

For the uninitiated, a keyserver is just an open repository of public PGP keys linked to UIDs like emails and names. Their existence means that if Alice wants to message Bob, who is someone that she's had no contact with before, she doesn't need to ask him for a public key, or find it herself, she can simply import it directly from a keyserver. This can also be really useful for verification; if Bob has signed something Alice wants to verify, again, she can just grab the key from the keyserver to check the signature.

Now you might be thinking, "Well, if there are lots of keyservers, how will I know where to find Bob's key?". This is the neat part, keyservers will propagate information in a similar way to DNS, which means that no matter where you publish your key it will be available everywhere (eventually).

This server does actually have an HTTP frontend, but not all of them do. The most common way to use these servers is directly from the command-line. Personally, I find it easiest to set:

```
keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com
keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve
```

in my `~/.gnupg/gpg.conf` which will mean that keys are, as you can imagine, automatically retrieved when you ask to encrypt or verify with a key that you don't have locally.

If you want to publish a key, just do:

```
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --send-keys yourkeyID
```

## F-Droid <a href="https://f-droid.org/" target="_blank"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>

<img src="/images/blog/best-sites/f-droid.png" style="width: 100%"></img>

Again, technically on the web, but maybe not something you'd use on your PC. F-Droid is a repository of free and open-source android apps, a kind of FOSS Google Play store. You can visit the link above to download the F-Droid apk, from which you can download other apps directly.

A repository like this, along with a ROM like <a href="https://lineageos.org/" target="_blank">LineageOS</a> opens up the possibility of completely removing Google from your Android phone, although I haven't been brave enough to go all the way myself.

## Nerd Fonts <a href="https://www.nerdfonts.com/" target="_blank"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>

<img src="/images/blog/best-sites/nerd-fonts.png" style="width: 100%"></img>

Nerd Fonts aggregates all your favourite dev fonts, patches them with a stupid number (9014+) of glyphs and just hands them to you for free. I use their fonts all over my system, it virtually guarantees that you'll be able to display any icon you come across.

The site itself also comes with a super handy <a href="https://www.nerdfonts.com/cheat-sheet" target="_blank">cheat sheet</a>, which lets you search for the icon you want. It's especially handy when, for example, ricing your status bar or notifications.

## cheat.sh <a href="https://cheat.sh/" target="_blank"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>

cheat.sh is, obviously, a cheat sheet. You can access it in a browser, but really it's supposed to work with curl (or their CLI). It offers references for command-line tools, programming languages, even text editors like vim and emacs.

Here's the home page as viewed with curl:

Lets say I wanted a quick reference on how to use dictionaries in python (make sure to scroll):

<pre style="height: 70vh; overflow: scroll">
~ $ curl cheat.sh/python/dict
#  In a function call
#  
#  `*t` means "treat the elements of this iterable as positional
#  arguments to this function call."

 def foo(x, y):
     print(x, y)

 >>> t = (1, 2)
 >>> foo(*t)
 1 2

#  Since v3.5, you can also do this in a list/tuple/set literals:

 >>> [1, *(2, 3), 4]
 [1, 2, 3, 4]

#  `**d` means "treat the key-value pairs in the dictionary as additional
#  named arguments to this function call."

 def foo(x, y):
     print(x, y)

 >>> d = {'x':1, 'y':2}
 >>> foo(**d)
 1 2

#  Since v3.5, you can also do this in a dictionary literals:

 >>> d = {'a': 1}
 >>> {'b': 2, **d}
 {'b': 2, 'a': 1}

#  In a function signature
#  
#  `*t` means "take all additional positional arguments to this function
#  and pack them into this parameter as a tuple."

 def foo(*t):
     print(t)

 >>> foo(1, 2)
 (1, 2)

#  `**d` means "take all additional named arguments to this function and
#  insert them into this parameter as dictionary entries."

 def foo(**d):
     print(d)

 >>> foo(x=1, y=2)
 {'y': 2, 'x': 1}

#  In assignments and `for` loops
#  
#  `*x` means "consume additional elements in the right hand side", but
#  it doesn't have to be the last item. Note that `x` will always be a
#  list:

 >>> x, *xs = (1, 2, 3, 4)
 >>> x
 1
 >>> xs
 [2, 3, 4]

 >>> *xs, x = (1, 2, 3, 4)
 >>> xs
 [1, 2, 3]
 >>> x
 4

 >>> x, *xs, y = (1, 2, 3, 4)
 >>> x
 1
 >>> xs
 [2, 3]
 >>> y
 4

 >>> for (x, *y, z) in [ (1, 2, 3, 4) ]: print(x, y, z)
 ...
 1 [2, 3] 4

#  ----
#  Note that parameters that appear after a `*` are keyword-only:

 def f(a, *, b): ...

 f(1, b=2)  # fine
 f(1, 2)    # error: b is keyword-only

#  Python3.8 added [positional-only
#  parameters](https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.8.htmlpositional-
#  only-parameters), meaning parameters that cannot be used as keyword
#  arguments. They are appear before a `/` (a pun on `*` preceding
#  keyword-only args).

 def f(a, /, p, *, k): ...

 f(  1,   2, k=3)  # fine
 f(  1, p=2, k=3)  # fine
 f(a=1, p=2, k=3)  # error: a is positional-only

#  [Elazar] [so/q/21809112] [cc by-sa 3.0]
</pre>

Obviously very useful, and the CLI is even easier to use. Admittedly I have noticed that sometimes it returns irrelevant or nonsense results, but it hardly ever happens, and the quality of the main pages more than makes up for it.

## wttr.in <a href="https://wttr.in/" target="_blank"><i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i></a>

Last but by no means least, another one for curl. wttr.in gets you a weather forecast in your terminal. I can't pretend I use this one very often, there are easier ways to get the weather, but it is undeniably very cool.

```
